# Logging Cleanup Summary

## Overview

After successfully fixing the JSON parsing issue in production, we've cleaned up all excessive debug logging that was added during the debugging process.

   - Removed extensive logging from `showMe` function
   - Removed debug logging from avatar upload function
   - Kept essential error logging only

2. **backend/src/controllers/authControllers.ts**

   - Removed debug console.log statements from password reset and change password functions
   - Kept critical error logging

3. **backend/src/middlewares/authorizeUserMiddleware.ts**

   - Removed all debug logging from authorization middleware
   - Streamlined function to core logic only

4. **backend/src/libs/passport/localStrategy.ts**

   - Cleaned up serializeUser and deserializeUser functions
   - Kept only essential error logging

5. **backend/src/libs/passport/googleStrategy.ts**

   - Cleaned up Google OAuth serializeUser and deserializeUser functions
   - Maintained error handling without excessive logging

6. **backend/src/helpers/sanitizeUser.ts**

- JSON parsing debugging (kept error handling)

## What Was Kept

- Essential error logging for production debugging
- Critical error handling and console.error statements
