# JSON Truncation Debug - Round 2

## Current Status

- **Issue persists**: Still receiving 377 bytes instead of 879 bytes
- **First fix failed**: Response stream handling fix didn't resolve the issue
- **Next approach**: More aggressive response handling + test route

## Attempted Fixes

### Fix 1: Response Stream Handling ❌

- Changed to clone response before reading
- Set explicit content-length headers
- **Result**: No change, still truncated at 377 bytes

### Fix 2: Aggressive Response Reconstruction ⏳

- Read response as ArrayBuffer instead of text
- Completely rebuild headers from scratch
- Only copy essential headers manually
- **Status**: Currently testing

### Fix 3: Direct Test Route ⏳

- Created `/api/test-direct` that bypasses proxy complexity
- Makes direct fetch to backend with minimal processing
- **Purpose**: Isolate if issue is in proxy logic vs. network layer

## Key Observations

1. **Backend logs show 879 bytes sent correctly**
2. **Browser receives exactly 377 bytes consistently**
3. **Content-Length header shows 377, not 879**
4. **Truncation happens at same position every time**

## Theories Being Tested

1. **Response stream corruption** in NextResponse handling
2. **Header inheritance issues** from backend response
3. **Vercel edge function limitations** with response size
4. **Character encoding problems** in text transmission

## Next Steps

1. Test aggressive response reconstruction fix
2. Test direct route to isolate proxy vs. network issues
3. If both fail, investigate Vercel function memory/response limits
4. Consider bypassing proxy entirely for this endpoint

## Emergency Backup Plan

If proxy route cannot be fixed:

- Move user authentication to server-side in layout
- Use server actions instead of client-side API calls
- Implement authentication at page level, not component level
